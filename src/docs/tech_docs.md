# Technical Documentation

Welcome to the **RBAC Express.js Starter Template** – a robust and scalable foundation for building secure RESTful APIs with **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.

This template is crafted with best practices in mind, using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **TypeScript**, **MySQL**, and **Knex**, and is ideal for building admin panels, internal tools, or any application requiring fine-grained permission control.

This documentation includes the following key areas:

- [ERD Diagram](#erd-diagram)
- [Architecture](#architecture)
- [Folder Structure](#folder-structure)
- [RBAC Implementation](#rbac-implementation)
- [Logging](#logging)
- [Integrating With External Services](#integrating-with-external-services)
